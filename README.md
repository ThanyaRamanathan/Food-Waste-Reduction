# Food-Waste-Reduction
In collaboration with a team, I contributed to a project aimed at reducing food waste, which was presented at the TUM.ai Makeathon 2021. The central focus of our initiative was the development of an innovative app (FoodEZ) designed to monitor users' grocery purchases and offer personalized recipe recommendations as items approached their expiration dates. The project utilized a recommendation system based on user preferences, incorporating collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods. Through the system, users could input their grocery items, and the app would intelligently suggest recipes based on their preferences and the items nearing expiration, ultimately encouraging sustainable and mindful consumption habits.

This recommendation system was part of a larger ecosystem dedicated to enhancing food waste reduction practices. By harnessing the power of data science and machine learning, our team aimed to empower users to make informed decisions about their food consumption, promoting a more sustainable and eco-friendly approach to daily life. The project showcased the potential of technology in addressing real-world challenges, contributing to the larger discourse on leveraging AI for positive societal impact.
